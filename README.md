# CPP-tutorial
This repo discusses the basic concepts of c++.

To start using C++, you need two things:

    ✴️A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
    ✴️A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand

There are many text editors and compilers to choose from.

👉 MyFirstCPP prints out using ```cout```, a standard output stream.
👉 User-input allows user input using ```cin``` that takes in data from the user and prints out the resulot using the ```cout``` stream.
